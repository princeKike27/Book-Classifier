# Book-Classifier

For this project I analyzed data from the Book-Crossings dataset, which contains 1.1 million ratings,
on a scale from 1-10, of 270,000 books by 90,000 users. In that sense, using the K-Nearest Neighbors
algorithm I created a book classifier that based on features like the bookÂ´s year of publication and 
its author will predict if I will like a book, and it will recommend me other similar books to read.

Throughout the project you will be able to find:

- Data cleaning and standardization.
- Analysis of Relevant features to build the model.
- KNN Model for book prediction and recommendations.
- Model testing.
